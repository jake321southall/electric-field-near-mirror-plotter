# Electric field near mirror plotter

Description: This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. 
Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. 
It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.

## Description
The main purpose of this project is to plot the equation 

![first equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%28x%2Ct%29%3D%5Ccos%5Cleft%28%5Cint_0%5Et%5COmega%28x-ct%27%29%7B%5Crm%20d%7Dt%27%5Cright%29%5Ccos%28x_t%29&plus;%5Csin%5Cleft%28%5Cint_0%5Et%5COmega%28x&plus;ct%27%29%7B%5Crm%20d%7Dt%27%5Cright%29%5Ccos%5Cleft%28x_%7B-t%7D%5Cright%29) 

where *x* denotes the coordinate along the *x*-axis, *t* denotes time,

The above equation represents the electric field expectation value of a coherent state in the presence of a mirror, in a fully quantum setting. We found that the results reproduce the classical dynamics of a sinusoidal wave in the presense of the mirror and this project gives a nice visual representataion of this behaviour.
To understand how this equation is derived, please see our [paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09500340.2021.1936241).
